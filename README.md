Creating a basic website for a basic-version of our last assignment, SFF_API

Only Vanilla Javascript is allowed, no Bootstrap or whatnot either.


Backend Issues:

- Images for each movie.

- Constraints on multiple things: - Number of the same movie allowed to rent.
                                  - Nullchecks on information passed.

- Bool for setting users as admin?

- Email-field for each user for notifications/newsletters.
